# Code Warriors Seeker - Version 2
## Problem
Client loved what was done on the previous project so much they've come for more.
They've asked to help add some features and improve some things:
#### Improvements:
1. A job seeker must login before assessing their Dashboard
2. All the work that was done in version 1 will now be behind a Dashboard (they have to login to see it)
#### Features:
1. As a job seeker, I want to see more jobs outside of Software Engineering
2. As a job seeker, I want to see the jobs by their respective categories
3. As a job seeker, I want to be able to filter jobs (on page, not navigating elsewhere)
4. As a job seeker, I want to be able to mail a job to a friend (using mailto: is good enough)

## Process and Solution
I start off by going over the features and improvements the client wants. Then I design a few mock wireframes using Balsamiq. The layouts give me a visual on what the client's app would look like. Also, provide me a guide on how to start reworking the webpages.
Build the web app. I use html and tailwind css to do that part. Tailwind CSS and MDN Web Docs websites are very helpful.
I add an image of software engineers working. The light blue color of the page shows a welcoming vibe for user.

Log into Adzuna to rerun their job search API. I want to include other jobs beside Software Engineering.
Also log into Postman inorder to use the API. Figuring out Adzuna API and adding the url into Postman to generate the json file was now easier than the first time I used them, because I've a better understanding this time.
There were a lot of playing around with the parameters to get the results I want.

The next step is to rework the javascript part. I type out additional pseudocode lines, so I can figure out my next steps.
Add the variables, then the event listener, and functions next. Issues that I ran into were adding filtering jobs and mailing features.

After completion, it was uploaded to GitHub and deployed on Vercel. I made sure the pages are link correctly.
